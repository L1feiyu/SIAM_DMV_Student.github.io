We are delighted to announce the upcoming SIAM Conference on Applied Mathematics Research (DMV Area). Through a collaborative effort involving several institutions' SIAM Student Chapters, including JHU, UMBC, GWU, GMU, Georgetown, UMD College Park, we aim to bring together students and faculty from the DMV area working on all types of mathematics research. The aim of this joint meeting among these neighboring institutions and SIAM student chapters presents an exceptional opportunity to bring together math researchers at all levels to learn from peers, share ideas and foster new collaborations. Please join us for poster sessions, research talks, and keynote speakers from distinguished faculty with research expertise spanning machine and statistical learning, numerical methods, mathematical biology, and more!
